Raft is a concensus algorithm simplified from paxo.

Concensus algorithm is used to replicate data/state as multiple machine. Having multiple machine to behave as one entity.

Don't copy and paste this code base, you can use as hint. Be sure to know what you are doing. You can read Raft paper by a simple google search.
